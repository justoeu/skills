# Fowler smell baseline — Standards axis

Fixed set from Fowler, *Refactoring*, ch.3. Applies even when the repo documents nothing.

**Two rules bind it:**

1. **The repo overrides.** A documented repo standard always wins; where it endorses something this baseline would flag, suppress the smell.
2. **Always a judgement call.** Each smell is a labelled heuristic ("possible Feature Envy"), never a hard violation. Skip anything tooling already enforces.

Each smell: **what it is → how to fix.** Match against the **diff**.

### Mysterious Name
A function, variable, or type whose name doesn't reveal what it does or holds. → Rename it; if no honest name comes, the design's murky.

### Duplicated Code
The same logic shape appears in more than one hunk or file in the change. → Extract the shared shape, call it from both.

### Feature Envy
A method that reaches into another object's data more than its own. → Move the method onto the data it envies.

### Data Clumps
The same few fields or params keep travelling together (a type wanting to be born). → Bundle them into one type, pass that.

### Primitive Obsession
A primitive or string standing in for a domain concept that deserves its own type. → Give the concept its own small type.

### Repeated Switches
The same switch/if-cascade on the same type recurs across the change. → Replace with polymorphism, or one map both sites share.

### Shotgun Surgery
One logical change forces scattered edits across many files in the diff. → Gather what changes together into one module.

### Divergent Change
One file or module is edited for several unrelated reasons. → Split so each module changes for one reason.

### Speculative Generality
Abstraction, parameters, or hooks added for needs the spec doesn't have. → Delete it; inline back until a real need shows.

### Message Chains
Long `a.b().c().d()` navigation the caller shouldn't depend on. → Hide the walk behind one method on the first object.

### Middle Man
A class or function that mostly just delegates onward. → Cut it, call the real target direct.

### Refused Bequest
A subclass or implementer that ignores or overrides most of what it inherits. → Drop the inheritance, use composition.
